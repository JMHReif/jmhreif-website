RAG is a method that enhances the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating them with external knowledge sources.
Each term represents a piece of the puzzle:
Retrieval - data retrieved from some external source outside the LLM (most often a database, but can include files, webpages, etc)
Augmented - &amp;#34;augmenting&amp;#34; (or adding to) an LLM’s training data.</description></item><item><title>Implementing RAG: How to write a graph retrieval query in LangChain</title><link>https://jmhreif.com/blog/2024/rag-demo-retrieval/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2024 09:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://jmhreif.com/blog/2024/rag-demo-retrieval/</guid><description>Photo credit What is RAG? This term is used a lot in today’s technical landscape, but what does it actually mean? Here are a few definitions from various sources:
&amp;#34;Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is the process of optimizing the output of a large language model, so it references an authoritative knowledge base outside of its training data sources before generating a response.&amp;#34; - Amazon Web Services
&amp;#34;Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a technique for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of generative AI models with facts fetched from external sources.</description></item></channel></rss>
