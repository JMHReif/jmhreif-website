There must be something that makes the blood-shot eyes, sleepless nights, and coffee-bolstered being worthwhile. While stressing over deadlines, fixing code bugs, and balancing personal life, some part of the true developer in us keeps chugging along, having faith that the reward is far greater than each obstacle.
Whether you are a young student choosing a career in an endless array of possibilities, an individual stuck in another career looking to make a switch, or a seasoned professional trying to remind yourself of the highlights in a career of software development, I hope there is something in this post for you that encourages you to thrive in your software development career and to bask in the light at the end of each tunnel.</description></item></channel></rss>
