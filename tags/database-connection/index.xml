Typically, in a Spring Boot application with Spring Data, you set the database credentials as properties in the application.properties file. You can run the application with just these details, but it only fails when the database URI has improper syntax. The application does not actually test the connection to see if it is valid and successfully connects.</description></item></channel></rss>
