The new M1 has been critically examined with avid enthusiasm and criticism, so I wasn’t sure what my outcome would be.
Thus far, it’s been positive, and I really haven’t noticed too much disruption in my work. Things have been faster, but I’m not sure whether to entirely attribute that new chip itself, or just the new machine, in general.</description></item></channel></rss>
