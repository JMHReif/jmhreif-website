This is one of my favorite events of the year, but it doesn’t happen without countless hours of planning and work to make it valuable to the graph community.
This year, my colleague and I were put in charge of organizing the schedule, determining how sessions are lined up between the start and end time of the event.</description></item><item><title>NODES 2024: How to Submit a Technical Presentation</title><link>https://jmhreif.com/blog/2024/nodes-2024-cfp/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2024 09:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://jmhreif.com/blog/2024/nodes-2024-cfp/</guid><description>Photo credit There is no shortage of technical events such as conferences, meetups, trainings, hackathons, and so on. These events are a great way to learn new things, connect with people, and share knowledge with others. One of the most valuable and exciting ways to share knowledge is by giving a technical presentation.
Today, we will look at how to submit a technical presentation for an event and get some personal recommendations from me, as well.</description></item></channel></rss>
