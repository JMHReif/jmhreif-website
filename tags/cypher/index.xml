This time, I’m going to show you how to find the data types of properties in Neo4j.
I frequently want to find out the data type of a property so that I can map it in an application (in Java). I can never remember off the top of my head, and when I Google the question, the results are often outdated (here’s the answer post, but the syntax is old).</description></item><item><title>Cypher Sleuthing: How to Get Data Types of Properties in Neo4j</title><link>https://jmhreif.com/blog/cypher-property-data-types/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Mar 2024 09:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://jmhreif.com/blog/cypher-property-data-types/</guid><description>Photo credit It’s been awhile since I wrote a Cypher Sleuthing post, but I’m back with a new one!

I invite you to join me and to continue with additional exploration and projects!
The data set is pulled from a Marc Hofman’s Github repository for the Java Almanac that also feeds a web browser version for the javaalmanac.</description></item><item><title>Cypher Sleuthing: Dealing with Dates, Part 5</title><link>https://jmhreif.com/blog/20210810-cypher-sleuthing-dates-part5/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2021 09:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://jmhreif.com/blog/20210810-cypher-sleuthing-dates-part5/</guid><description>From part 1 introducing Cypher dates and formats to part 4 where we combined duration functions and temporal components to translate amounts in one unit to another unit, we have covered a lot of ground in this series!

My previous part 1, part 2, and part 3 posts on this topic introduced Cypher dates, translated formats to the Cypher-supported ISO 8601 format, calculated durations, accessed components, and translated durations to certain values.
If you read those, then this post is the next post showing how to convert durations across component categories. If you haven’t read the previous posts leading up to this one, feel free to catch up (recommend at least Part 3 as this post’s prequel) - though it isn’t required.</description></item><item><title>Cypher Sleuthing: Dealing with Dates, Part 4</title><link>https://jmhreif.com/blog/cypher-sleuthing-dates-part4/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 12:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://jmhreif.com/blog/cypher-sleuthing-dates-part4/</guid><description>Photo credit *Updated Dec 15, 2021

My previous part 1 and part 2 posts on this topic introduced Cypher dates, translated formats to the Cypher-supported ISO 8601 format, calculated durations, and measured lengths of time. If you read those, then this post is the next step with Cypher dates on date components, component translations, and duration conversions.

My previous part 1 post on this topic introduced Cypher dates and translated a few other date formats to the Cypher-supported ISO 8601 format. If you read that, then this post is the next step with Cypher dates that covers durations and more.

Different date formats require calculations between application date pickers in user-friendly formats and system dates in backend devices and data sources. Then, programming languages each have their own libraries and structures for dealing with dates, too.
This concept in the Neo4j ecosystem isn’t any less complex with Cypher (a graph query language) date formats, the APOC library date functions/procedures, and countless possible integration tools/APIs for data import and export.</description></item><item><title>Cypher Sleuthing: Dealing with Dates, Part 1</title><link>https://jmhreif.com/blog/cypher-sleuthing-dates-part1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Apr 2021 12:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://jmhreif.com/blog/cypher-sleuthing-dates-part1/</guid><description>No matter what database, programming language, or webpage you might be using, dates always seem to cause headaches.

Sometimes, queries will invoke what is called the eager operator in order to maintain consistent operations and avoid conflicting data changes.
It still leaves the question, though, of what does this eager operation do differently and why would it be important enough to specifically avoid in certain situations?</description></item><item><title>Cypher Sleuthing: the EAGER operator</title><link>https://jmhreif.com/blog/cypher-sleuthing-eager-operator/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jul 2019 12:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://jmhreif.com/blog/cypher-sleuthing-eager-operator/</guid><description>Why is it that some query syntax seems to run faster than another when there is very little difference between the statements?
