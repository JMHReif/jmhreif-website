This post begins the migration process by taking a Spring Data Neo4j 5 application with OGM and upgrades to the dependencies and syntax changes of Spring Data Neo4j 6.
Without further ado, let’s dive in!
Current application overview The code for today’s migration is a specific branch in the migration Github repository.</description></item><item><title>Winter to Spring: Migrating from Spring Data Neo4j 5 to 6, Part 1</title><link>https://jmhreif.com/blog/migrate-sdn-part1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2021 09:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://jmhreif.com/blog/migrate-sdn-part1/</guid><description>Photo credit A major upgrade to Spring Data Neo4j was released at the end of last year as part of the Spring Data release train. If you were involved in Spring Data and Neo4j news before that, you may have seen hints of this coming with the SDN/RX library entering the scene in late 2019. The library brought with it a lighter footprint, as well as a more straightforward implementation of features to reduce confusion and errors (therefore also improving efficiency) in development and production.</description></item><item><title>Create a Data Marvel with Spring Data Neo4j</title><link>https://jmhreif.com/blog/create-data-marvel-sdn/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 12:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://jmhreif.com/blog/create-data-marvel-sdn/</guid><description>Photo credit I have had a couple of Github projects demonstrating bits of functionality for Spring Data Neo4j, but they had last been updated in 2020 when the new Spring Data Neo4j 6 was still a beta version known as SDN/RX. Since there have been several changes since then, I thought I would give the projects a refresh and make them current.
