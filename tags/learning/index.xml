The new M1 has been critically examined with avid enthusiasm and criticism, so I wasn’t sure what my outcome would be.
Thus far, it’s been positive, and I really haven’t noticed too much disruption in my work. Things have been faster, but I’m not sure whether to entirely attribute that new chip itself, or just the new machine, in general.</description></item><item><title>In the Language Wars, Java Holds Its Own</title><link>https://jmhreif.com/blog/2019/java-holds-its-own/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2019 12:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://jmhreif.com/blog/2019/java-holds-its-own/</guid><description>We all pick our favorites and downplay other options (colors, cars, sports team, etc.). Programming language choice is not exempt. Whether it’s the one we are most comfortable with or the one that got us a job, we cling to that choice.
Today, we will focus on Java. There are perfectly valid complaints and praises for this language, and we will cover them. As always, these are my experiences, so others may see things differently.</description></item></channel></rss>
