If you were involved in Spring Data and Neo4j news before that, you may have seen hints of this coming with the SDN/RX library entering the scene in late 2019. The library brought with it a lighter footprint, as well as a more straightforward implementation of features to reduce confusion and errors (therefore also improving efficiency) in development and production.</description></item><item><title>Create a Data Marvel with Spring Data Neo4j</title><link>https://jmhreif.com/blog/create-data-marvel-sdn/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 12:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://jmhreif.com/blog/create-data-marvel-sdn/</guid><description>Photo credit I have had a couple of Github projects demonstrating bits of functionality for Spring Data Neo4j, but they had last been updated in 2020 when the new Spring Data Neo4j 6 was still a beta version known as SDN/RX. Since there have been several changes since then, I thought I would give the projects a refresh and make them current.
