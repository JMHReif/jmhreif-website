It seems I hadn’t converted Homebrew (a package manager for macOS) for compatibility with Apple Silicon. I mostly use Homebrew to install packages I rarely use (such as Ruby or Python libraries), so perhaps that’s why I hadn’t noticed. However, this issue surfaced because I tried to install a Python package (Poetry) to work on a generative AI project, and it was looking for Python in the wrong place.</description></item></channel></rss>
