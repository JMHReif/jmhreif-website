NOTES:
Create index (working):
```
CALL apoc.vectordb.pinecone.createCollection(null, 'test-index', 'cosine', 1536, { headers: {`Api-Key`: "<YOUR KEY HERE>"}, body: { spec: { serverless: { cloud: "aws", region: "us-east-1"}}}});
```

When I dug into code, realized that there’s not functionality missing…but the config was a bit hidden.
Just like with `headers` key config, you can add the required fields for Pinecone index spec in the config, as well
Documentation uses “optional config”, but actually, depending on proc, it isn’t optional….you still have to specify API key (not optional)
For the create collection, you have to specify an index type (`pod` or `serverless`), then all the subdetails that go with each
I recommend looking closely at the Pinecone API docs to find out what params are required
Also took some trial and error to figure out that I haven’t been succesful supplying the HostKey in the 1st param…and how to structure the body part of the index specs.
Maybe some improvement to documentation and examples are needed…hoping to submit a PR on that soon.
