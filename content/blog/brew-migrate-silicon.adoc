I have been https://jmhreif.com/blog/docker-intel-to-m1/[using an Apple M1 laptop^] since autumn of 2021, but I just recently came across an issue that surprised me. It seems I hadn't converted Homebrew (a package manager for macOS) for compatibility with Apple Silicon. I mostly use Homebrew to install packages I rarely use (such as Ruby or Python libraries), so perhaps that's why I hadn't noticed. However, this issue surfaced because I tried to install a Python package (Poetry) to work on a generative AI project, and it was looking for Python in the wrong place.

After diving down some rabbit holes to determine the actual root of the problem, I was able to migrate Homebrew for Apple Silicon. Here's how I did it.

== The problem

First, I tried to install Poetry using the official installer (per the https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer[documentation instructions^]):

[source,shell]
----
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
----

That produced the following error:

[source,shell]
----
dyld[69425]: Library not loaded: @loader_path/../Python
  Referenced from: <DAED6A8B-509E-3042-B1F9-2F792191741A> /Users/jenniferreif/Library/Application Support/pypoetry/venv/bin/python3.11
  Reason: tried: '/Users/jenniferreif/Library/Application Support/pypoetry/venv/bin/../Python' (no such file), '/usr/local/lib/Python' (no such file), '/usr/lib/Python' (no such file, not in dyld cache)

Traceback:
  File "<stdin>", line 923, in main
  File "<stdin>", line 562, in run
----

Hm, so looks like it can't find Python. Next, I ran a command to ensure I had Python installed:

[source,shell]
----
jenniferreif@elf-lord ~ % python3 --version
Python 3.11.4
jenniferreif@elf-lord ~ % which python3
/usr/local/bin/python3
jenniferreif@elf-lord ~ % which python
python not found
----

Python shows up in `/usr/local/bin`, but that doesn't look like that's where Poetry is looking for it. After a quick web search, many people found this to be a problem when they upgraded brew packages, so uninstalling and reinstalling Poetry seemed to fix it. However, I checked whether I had an existing Poetry installation (`poetry --version`), and I did not. After a bit of digging, I also confirmed that Homebrew typically installs packages in the `/usr/local/bin`, so Homebrew is likely the culprit.

Next, I thought I had better update Homebrew to the latest version, so I ran `brew update`. That ran well, so I figured I'd better try to upgrade in case of a newer release, since it had been awhile. That's where I ran into another error:

[source,shell]
----
Error: Cannot install under Rosetta 2 in ARM default prefix (/opt/homebrew)!
To rerun under ARM use:
    arch -arm64 brew install ...
To install under x86_64, install Homebrew into /usr/local.
----

Ok, so it looks like this might be the root problem, and this needs fixed before I can fix the problem with Poetry. I tried to run the suggested command under ARM use, but it needs an argument after the "install" keyword, so I did some research first on the error.

Many solutions were from 2022 or early 2023 saying that Homebrew didn't yet fully support the ARM architecture. The solutions recommended using the `arch -arm64` prefix for every command, but I wanted to first verify that Homebrew doesn't still include ARM. I went to Homebrew's website and did a search for "silicon" on their docs. According to their https://docs.brew.sh/Installation#macos-requirements[Installation docs^], they do!

Now, since I had an existing Homebrew installation from my Intel machine that had been transferred to my M1 machine, I needed to migrate it to the new architecture. I found a couple of extremely helpful blog posts that explained how to do this, so I combined some of the details of each. I'll list the steps next.

== The solution

This https://earthly.dev/blog/homebrew-on-m1/[first blog post^] came from the perspective of having both the Intel laptop and M1 laptop side-by-side and installing on the M1 from a clean slate. Since I don't have the old laptop, I mainly used steps from https://yepz.dk/blog/brew-migrate-intel-to-m1/[this second blog post^] that explained how to migrate an existing installation.

1. Run `brew bundle dump` to create a Brewfile containing the list of all your existing Homebrew-installed packages.
2. Run the following command to install Homebrew in the `/opt/homebrew` directory: `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`
3. Per https://earthly.dev/blog/homebrew-on-m1/[blog post 1^] (under the "Install Homebrew" section), follow your output of the previous command to add the Homebrew directory to your PATH. Because Homebrew is installed in a new location, it needs to know where to look. The commands should look something like those shown in my output below:
```
==> Next steps:
- Run these two commands in your terminal to add Homebrew to your PATH:
    (echo; echo 'eval "$(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)"') >> /Users/jenniferreif/.zprofile
    eval "$(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)"
- Run brew help to get started
- Further documentation:
    https://docs.brew.sh
```
[start=4]
4. Run `brew bundle install` to install all your packages from the Brewfile.

And that's it!

== Back where I began

In case you might be wondering if I ever got Poetry installed, I did! Running the Poetry install right after the brew change didn't immediately solve it, but I ran `brew update` and then `brew upgrade` to ensure I had all the latest in Homebrew. Then I ran the following command to install Poetry:

[source,shell]
----
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
----

Next, I had to follow the output instructions to add Poetry to my PATH. I added the following to my shell profile:

[source,shell]
----
export PATH="<path specified in output>:$PATH"
----

Finally, I ran `poetry --version` to verify that it was installed!

Note: I could've also installed Poetry using Homebrew, but Poetry says that installation is not supported, so I figured I'd try to get the official installer to work first.

== Wrap up

In this post, I walked through my process of migrating Homebrew from an Intel installation to an Apple Silicon installation. I also ran into an issue with installing the Poetry Python package, which I was able to resolve after migrating Homebrew. I hope this helps you if you run into a similar issue!
