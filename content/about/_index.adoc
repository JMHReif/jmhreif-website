==== A bit more detail:
I am a developer and advocate with a passion for data and the stories it can tell. I am currently working on the Developer Relations team at Neo4j to help developers be successful with graphs and graph-related technologies. My specialties are in Java, along with its ecosystem of tools and frameworks, as well as graphs and data. When I'm not solving problems, I frequently speak at technical conferences and events all around the world. Most recently, I manage the GraphStuff.FM podcast, co-hosting with colleagues and interviewing amazing people in various technology communities.

==== Personal life:
I am a former musician turned developer, with a love of most things creative and/or geeky. I enjoy learning and trying new things, and I am always up for a good challenge. My favorite things are coffee, reading, music, horses, traveling, and spending time with my family.
