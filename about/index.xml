She has traveled the world to participate in world-class technical events with audiences large and small. Speaking provides a way to share her learnings and experiences with others and learn from theirs, as well. Many of her slide decks are available on Jennifer’s SpeakerDeck page or included in her code projects on Github, and recordings of presentations are aggregated to a YouTube playlist.</description></item></channel></rss>
