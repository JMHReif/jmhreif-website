She has traveled the world to participate in world-class technical events with audiences large and small.
Speaking provides a way to share her learnings and experiences with others and learn from theirs, as well. Many of her slide decks are available on Jenniferâ€™s SpeakerDeck page or included in her code projects on Github, and recordings of presentations are aggregated to a YouTube playlist.</description></item></channel></rss>
